# Pinnawala Central College Student Database
##Introduction
PCC Student Database Software is an open-source project developed by PITZ (Pinnawala Info Tech Zone; The official IT Club / Society for Pinnawala Central College) in order to reduce the conflicts that occur when humans use their own hands in finding student records and custom queries such as **'Grade 8 Students from Mawanella'** or as complex as **'Male Students from Mawanella, who are participating in the school cadet team, and following Science Stream'**.
##Functionality
PCCSD (referred to the Pinnawala Central College Student Database System hereby) is based on a **complex Query Management System** developed by PITZ which allows the administrators to find the exact results for their *Ultra Customized Query*. PCCSD functions best in local computers to give the best in speed and allocation of static memory.
##New animations and functionality flows
With the new WPF platform and it's functionality flows we have optimized the User Experience with Animations.
##Do you have MySQL installed on your computer?
Now, that's not a problem if you use PCCSD Systems for your software, because we supply natural algorithms for delivering the required results just in case that there is no available MySQL installed in the users computer.
